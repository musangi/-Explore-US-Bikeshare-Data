# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

# What Software is Needed?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
  - You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
  - A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
  - A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

# Running the program
You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.

# Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

 - most common month
 - most common day of week
 - most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip
  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station
#3 Trip duration
  - total travel time
  - average travel time 
#4 User info
  - counts of each user type
  - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

# Requirements
  - Language: Python 3.6 or above
  - Libraries: pandas, numpy, time
# Project Data
  - chicago.csv - Stored in the data folder, the chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

  - new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.

  - washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.

# Built with
  - Python 3.6.6 - The language used to develop this.
  - pandas - One of the libraries used for this.
  - numpy - One of the libraries used for this.
  - time - One of the libraries used for this.
